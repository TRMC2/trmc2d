                    ---------------------------
                    tempd: a temperature daemon
                    ---------------------------

    This package contains the source code of tempd: a temperature
    daemon, based on libtrmc2, for driving the TRMC2 temperature
    controller. It also has the code for trmc2shell, a non-network
    shell for the TRMC2 speaking the same language as tempd.

REQUIREMENTS

    You need libtrmc2 and its associated header file Trmc.h installed
    somewhere where your compiler can find them. If they are installed
    somewhere where gcc won't look, you will have to edit the Makefile
    and add the appropriate -I and -L options.

    Additionally, trmc2shell requires libreadline and libtermcap.

COMPILING

    For tempd, just type `make'. If you want trmc2shell, type `make
    trmc2shell'.

RUNNING

    Type `tempd -d' as root, then connect a client to /tmp/tempd-socket.

    Or type `trmc2shell' as root and talk to it at the keyboard.

FILES

    README:             this file
    protocol.html:      documentation of the tempd language
    Makefile:           needed for `make'
    constants.[ch], interpreter.[ch], io.[ch], parse.[ch]:
                        source code common to tempd and trmc2shell
    tempd.c:            source code of tempd
    trmc2shell.c:       source code of trmc2shell

BUGS

    It doesn't work ;-). Well, not yet.

    The programs won't try to initialize the TRMC2, therefore they don't
    need root privileges, and there is no point in plugging in a TRMC2.
    They do need libtrmc2 though. Their only use right now is to give
    you a feeling of what they will be. For example:

        $ ./trmc2shell 
        trmc2> *idn?
        tempd temperature server, Laboratoire Louis Néel, Jul 2004
        trmc2> board:count?
        trmc2> error?
        _TRMC_NOT_INITIALIZED
        trmc2> so:initialize:it:please!
        trmc2> error?
        NO_SUCH_COMMAND
        trmc2> quit
        $

    You can also play at connecting a client to /tmp/tempd-socket and
    have the same kind of dialog with tempd.

    If you kill tempd instead of asking it to `quit', it will not remove
    /tmp/fieldd-socket. Next time you try to run tempd, it will exit
    immediately and you will see no error message... unless you look in
    your system's logs:

        # grep tempd /var/log/messages
        Jul 16 22:18:05 bonet tempd: bind: Address already in use

    Just remove the socket and restart tempd.
